   **Model**: Random Forest  
   **Components**: Decision Trees ensemble  
   **Bootstrap**: Sampling with replacement  
   **Voting**: Majority Vote  



**Description**

Implemented Random Forest by combining multiple decision trees. 
Each tree is built using a bootstrap sample of the training data. 
For each tree, the best split is determined using the decision treeâ€™s split function (based on entropy). 
For prediction, each tree votes on the class label, and the final prediction is made by majority vote.
