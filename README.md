# DS-ML-in-C++

In this repository on daily basis I will implement machine learning and Data Science algorithms fully coded in C++. 

1st Day)**linear_regression.cpp**

    model: **linear regression**,
  
    loss functions: **MAE, MSE, RMSE**, 
  
    optimization function: **gradient descent**
  

2nd Day)**logistic_regression.cpp**

    model: **logistic regression**,
  
    loss function: **crossentropy**,
  
    optimization funciton: **RMSprop**


3rd Day)**least_squares.cpp**  

    model: **least squares**
    
    loss function: **sum of squared errors**
    
    optimization function: **analytical solution**


4th Day)**KNearestNeighbours.cpp**

    model: **KNN**


5th Day)**SVM.cpp**

    model: **SVM**
